        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            In 1995, EMI released their debut album, A Typical and Autoctonal Venezuelan Dance Band, which was a huge success in
            their home country, enabling them to sell out clubs around Caracas for the next couple of years. In 1996, David Byrne's
            Luaka Bop record label signed the group after discovering a CD they had planted in a New York City record store. Shortly
            thereafter, they went into the studio to work on their sophomore record, The New Sound of the Venezuelan Gozadera, which
            was released in 1998 and received accolades from press and musicians alike. Two years later and under the direction of
            famed producer Philip Steir, they released Arepa 3000: A Venezuelan Journey into Space, which received a Grammy
            nomination in the category of "Best Latin Alternative Album" and a Latin Grammy in the category of "Best Rock Album."
            Following the success of this release, the band relocated to New York City and began work on their masterpiece, The
            Venezuelan Zinga Son, Vol. 1, produced by "Little" Louie Vega of Masters at Work. Initially, the album was released in
            the UK and Japan through Long Lost Brothers Records, though a year later, Luaka Bop released the album in the US,
            resulting in another Latin Grammy nomination in the category of "Best Alternative Latin Album."
        
            After ending their recording contract with Luaka Bop, Los Amigos Invisibles started their own label, Gozadera Records.
            The first release, Chill Out Venezuela, was a multiple-genre collection of Venezuelan artists, produced by Los Amigos
            Invisibles. For Gozadera's next release and the band's fifth studio album, they enlisted Dimitri from Paris to produce a
            collection of Venezuelan cover songs entitled, Super Pop Venezuela, which was initially offered in their native country
            only. In 2006, the album was released in the US, landing the band yet another Grammy nomination in the category of "Best
            Urban Latin Alternative Album."
        
            After three years of anticipation, Los Amigos Invisibles released their album, Commercial, in a joint effort between
            Gozadera Records and Nacional Records. In an interview with America's National Public Radio,[1] the band explained that
            the change in style was not by accident, nor was the decision to name the latest project Commercial. Rather, it is a
            tongue-in-cheek reference to band's former musical self.[1] The release was a hit in Venezuela, debuting at #1 on the
            music charts. During the week of July 7, 2009, their song, "Vivire Para Ti" featuring Natalia Lafourcade, was offered as
            Single of the Week in the iTunes music store and in November 2009, Commercial won the Latin Grammy in the category of
            Best Alternative Music Album.
        
            Following their Grammy win, 2010 saw festival appearances and shows throughout the United States, Latin America, Europe,
            Australia and New Zealand.
        
            In 2011, the band released Not So Commercial, an EP of outtakes from the Commercial album. This album was a nominee for
            the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album in 2012.
        
            In April 2013, Repeat After Me was released.[2] This album received a Grammy nomination in the category of "Best Latin
            Alternative Album" and a Latin Grammy in the category of "Best Alternative Album", "Song of the year" and "Best Cover".
        
            In 2014, they were named Pop Artist of the Year at the Pepsi Venezuela Music Awards.[3] That year, keyboardist Armando
            Figueredo and guitarist José Luis Pardo (Cheo) left the band. Both were original members.
        
            In 2015, they released Acústico, a compilation of their greatest hits played in an acoustic style.
        
            2017 saw the release of the album El Paradise. This was followed by a concert tour in the United States.
